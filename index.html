The cost of a <b>Mombasa air ticket</b> versus the cost of a <b>Mombasa train ticket</b> is probably the biggest factor most travelers consider when choosing between flying to Mombasa or using the <b>SGR train to Mombasa, </b> the train is obviously much more affordable. A one-way train ticket from Nairobi to Mombasa goes for KES 2,000 on economy class and KES 4000 on first class, on the other hand, the price of <b>air tickets to Mombasa</b> varies wildly depending on many factors such as demand, Competition among several local <b>Mombasa airlines</b> has helped bring down the cost of <b>Mombasa Flight</b> tickets but despite the free market’s best efforts, the flight prices are still higher than that of train tickets. Mombasa is approximately 480 kilometers from Nairobi. Covering such a distance can be a time-consuming endeavor. A flight from Nairobi to Mombasa takes about 1hour and 15 more minutes if one is flying direct to <b>Diani</b>. The train, on the other hand, takes six hours. Furthermore, if one is traveling to Diani one has to then use a taxi service from the train station to Diani which is about 40 kilometers away. Further still, there is bound to be traffic in Mombasa, especially at the ferry crossing to get to the Mombasa, this can add a couple of hours to one’s journey from Nairobi. Such logistics leave Kenyans weighing between paying for an expensive flight to Mombasa and saving time or paying for an affordable train ticket to Mombasa but losing time that could be spent relaxing at <b>Mombasa Beach hotel</b> or by the Mombasa beach. A soft advantage, so to speak, of using the train is that it passes through Tsavo National Park where passengers are treated to the sight of wildlife such as elephants. As such, the experience of either flying to Mombasa or using the train is perhaps a bucket list item for many-a-tourist, and therefore, cost and time do not even come into consideration. <b>Flying to Mombasa</b> for the first time can be the highlight of one’s <b>trip to Mombasa. </b> Some travelers may save up and buy an expensive air ticket to Mombasa just to fulfill their dream of flying. On the other hand, using the train has a road trip feel to it. All one has to do is ensure one’s traveling party sits together, brings snacks, and buys some drinks, which are sold on the train by the way, and travel sharing stories and enjoying the scenery. On this point, it comes down to personal preference By Road: <b>Mombasa Buses</b> are not usually the favorite mode of transport in the city of Mombasa but they are available for travelling outside the <b>city of Mombasa. </b> When you reach the place, you can take a local taxi, tuk tuks or local busses to travel inside the city.

    <h2>Is Mombasa Safe to Visit?</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      Generally, <b>Mombasa is safe to visit</b> as long as you take the necessary precautions to ensure your safety. As with any popular tourist holiday destination, petty crimes like pickpocketing and purse-snatching can occur if you do not pay attention to your surroundings or take care of your belongings.
